This is a project which takes a stock ticker as user input, and outputs to the UI the stock price along with financial metrics for the company in a table. 

## Project Motivation

The motivation for this project was to learn how to pull data from APIs using Axios, and learning how to use the concept of 'State' in the React framework by manipulating state based on user input, and mapping that State to the UI.
